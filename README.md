# Sleep Efficiency Dashboard in Power BI 
Welcome to the Sleep Efficiency Dashboard Case Study on Power BI. In this project, we will explore a real-world dataset from Kaggle to analyze sleep efficiency trends and identify factors that may impact it. Our goal is to create a comprehensive and visually appealing Power BI dashboard that provides valuable insights into sleep efficiency and suggests strategies for improving it.

## Objective
The objective of this case study is to leverage Power BI to gain insights into sleep efficiency patterns, answer important questions related to sleep quality, and propose data-driven strategies to enhance sleep efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset provided for this case study is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about individuals' sleep patterns, sleep durations, and sleep efficiency. It provides a valuable resource to analyze factors that may influence sleep quality.

## Project Tasks
The following tasks will be performed to analyze and visualize the sleep efficiency data using Power BI:

#### Data Exploration
Familiarize ourselves with the dataset, understand the available fields, and identify relevant information for sleep efficiency analysis.
#### Data Preparation
Perform necessary data cleaning, transformations, and create calculated columns to enhance the dataset for sleep efficiency analysis.
Sleep Efficiency Analysis: Calculate sleep efficiency metrics, identify trends, and explore patterns that may affect sleep quality.

#### Visualizations
Create insightful visualizations, reports, and dashboards using Power BI to effectively communicate sleep efficiency insights.
Sleep Improvement Strategies: Based on the analysis, propose data-driven strategies to improve sleep efficiency and overall sleep quality.

#### Project Deliverables
The project deliverables include the following:

Power BI Report: A dynamic and visually appealing report in PDF format showcasing sleep efficiency analysis, insights, and visualizations.
Video Dashboard/Report: As the Power BI dashboard cannot be published directly, we will provide a video link demonstrating the interactive features and functionality of the dashboard.
Video Link: As it cannot be published. Video link: https://youtu.be/BFLSorYwUyQ

## Conclusion
The Sleep Efficiency Dashboard case study will provide valuable insights into sleep patterns and efficiency factors, allowing us to suggest evidence-based strategies for enhancing sleep quality. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, we aim to present the analysis in an engaging and visually compelling manner, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and make informed decisions.

Let's dive into the data and begin our journey towards a better understanding of sleep efficiency!
